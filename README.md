# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website showcasing my skills, work experience, and projects. It is built using **HTML** and **CSS** without any JavaScript for transitions. The website is fully responsive and includes smooth scrolling and page transitions.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes and devices.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: CSS `scroll-behavior` is used for smooth navigation between sections.
- **Page Transitions**: Sections fade in and slide up into view when navigated using the CSS `:target` pseudo-class.
- **Custom Logo**: A logo is positioned on the far left of the header, while the navigation menu aligns on the right.

## Sections

1. **Home**: Introduction and overview of the portfolio.
2. **About Me**: Details about my skills, experience, and technologies I work with.
3. **Projects**:
   - **Analysis of the Automobile Website** (03/2023 – 06/2023): Python and Power BI-based project involving data analysis and visualization with automated pipelines.
   - **Rasa NLU Chatbot** (11/2023 – present): A conversational AI chatbot for a Job Portal website, built using the Rasa framework.
4. **Contact**: A simple form for users to get in touch.
